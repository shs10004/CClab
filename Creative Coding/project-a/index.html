                Bubble was likely first developed around 810 years ago dating it back to 1215. This is around the time of Chinggis Khan and his rule. Though it is very old it wasn't until 10/31/2024 when, NYU Shanghai Student, Sabrina Schreck discovered it. She has attempted to study it for the past year, but it is very interesting. It only appears dark enough to be noticeable in the month of October. This is how the name bubble came about. Besides appearing like a bubble, it is only visible during a certain bubble of time.

                <span class="red"> Guidelines for human interaction with this creature: </span>
                It is important to be cautious when approaching these creatures. They are very old, but fast. If you leave your hand in for too long it will follow you. Feel free to watch as they become scared when you touch one of them. Their fear is represented in their changing appearance. This is to mimic the other cells, and thus confuse you as to who is who. However, they are completely harmless creatures.
