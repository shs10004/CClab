    <h3 class="orange">Description:</h3>
    <p>Because it was Halloween this past weekend, I made a dancing pumpkin. This is an adorable orange pumpkin with
      leaves and a stem. Its eye bounces back and forth. The legs and stem move in vertical motions to resemble bouncing
      or
      jumping from side to side. The entire pumpkin also moves side to side. </p>

    <h3 class="orange">Strugles:</h3>
    <p>Overall, after struggling in the beginning, I began to get the hang of it. At first, I struggled with not using
      the global variable. Having used it so much previously, it was hard to switch. Now, it's a lot easier
      to understand and can work at a steady pace. The code on the right shows where I struggled the most. I got
      help from Professor Gohai. He explained how to use this.____ again which was very beneficail. After, I could do it
      myself, and I understood when I needed to replace certain numbers with this._____. </p>

    <h3 class="orange">The Code:</h3>
    <p>
      this.x = startX;
      this.y = startY;
      this.pupilX = 0;
      this.pupilSpeedX = 0.3;
      this.h = 0;


      this.pupilX = this.pupilX + this.pupilSpeedX;
      if (this.pupilX > 5) {
      this.pupilSpeedX = this.pupilSpeedX * -1;
      }
      if (this.pupilX less than -5) { this.pupilSpeedX=this.pupilSpeedX * -1; } this.h=200 + sin(frameCount / 10) * 5;

    <span class="orange">What is the benefit of your class not relying on any code outside of its own definition?</span>
  <p>
    The benefit of not relying on outside code is that each code can have its own variable. This means you could have
    many different drawings and functions working together without any worry of overlap. This can be especially helpful
    for group projects or if you are creating a very long and complicated code.
  </p>
  <br>
  <span class="orange"> What makes it challenging to write code that has to harmonize with the code other people have
    written? </span>
  <p>
    The challenge is not having code that overlaps. If there is an identical function or variable, then the code might
    cause an error. So, it is important not to use global variables. Additionally, it is important to keep labeling each
    code and using console.log. This makes it easier to track if an issue ever arises.
