    <h3 class="orange">Description:</h3>
    <p>Because it was Halloween this past weekend, I made a dancing pumpkin. This is a very cute orange pumpkin with
      lags and a steam. Its eye bounce back and forth. The legs and stem move in vertical motions to resmbel bouncing or
      jumping from side to side. The entire pumpkin also moves side to side. </p>

    <h3 class="orange">Strugles:</h3>
    <p>Overall, after struggling in the begining, I began to get the hang of it. At first, I struggles with not using
      the global variable. Having been using it so much previously, it was hard to switch. Now, I think its a lot easier
      to understand and am able to work at a steady pace. The code on the right show where I struggled the most. I got
      help from Professor Gohai. He explained how to use this.____ again which was very beneficail. After, I could do it
      myself, and I understood when I needed to replace certain numbers with this._____. </p>

    <h3 class="orange">The Code:</h3>
    <p>
      this.x = startX;
      this.y = startY;
      this.pupilX = 0;
      this.pupilSpeedX = 0.3;
      this.h = 0;


      this.pupilX = this.pupilX + this.pupilSpeedX;
      if (this.pupilX > 5) {
      this.pupilSpeedX = this.pupilSpeedX * -1;
      }
      if (this.pupilX less than -5) { this.pupilSpeedX=this.pupilSpeedX * -1; } this.h=200 + sin(frameCount / 10) * 5;

    <span class="orange">What is the benefit of your class not relying on any code outside of its own definition?</span>
  <p>
    The benefit is that each code can have it own variable. This means you could have many differnt drawings and
    functions working together without any worry for overlap.
  </p>
  <br>
  <span class="orange"> What makes it challenging to write code that has to harmonize with the code other people have
    written? </span>
  <p>
    The challange is not having code that overlaps. If there is an identical function or variable then the code might
    cause an error. So, it is important to not use global varibales. Additioanlly, it is important to keep labeling each
    code, and using console.log. This makes it easier to track if an issue ever arises.
