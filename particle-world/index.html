        <p>My project is a classic popcorn bucket with popcorn poping out of it. I wanted to create a fun particle
          drawing that everyone would know about it. With it being November and the second to last "ber" months I
          thought this would be perfect. Looking at my project I hope people think of snuggling up in their pjs, putting
          on their favorite TV show or movie, and holding a warm buttery bowl of popcorn in hand. Then, out of nowhere
          you are startled and your popcorn flies everywhere. The flying popcorn are the particles.

        <h3 class="red">What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a Class and an Instance of the Class?</h3>
        <p> Object-Oriented Programming is what it sounds like. It is a code the focuses on the object of the code. It
          contains both the display of the function as well as the updates. A class is when similar data can be clumped
          together
          to form a "class". Then you can multiply that initial class. An instance of the class is when we used the word
          "new" followed by the name of the class.

        </p>

        <h3 class="red">Discuss the effectiveness of OOP. When is OOP useful? In what way can it be utilized?</h3>
        <p> OOP is very effective. It simplifies your code down and allows you to have each object to contain its own
          features and updates. It can be utilized to making particles and allow for greater reusability of the code.

        </p>

        <h3 class="red">Describe the objects you have created. What properties and methods were implemented? What kind
          of behaviors did you create by manipulating them?</h3>
        <p> This project was very fun but challanging. I changed the colors using color mode and hue. This allows each
          popcorn to be different from one another. Additioanlly, I changed the speed and so it goes up, down, left, and
          right in random directions. I think using random for a project like this works quite well. It creates an
          element of suprise and makes it overall more enjoyable to look at.
        </p>
        <h3 class="red">Please share it if there is any challenging and confusing aspect(s) in the OOP concepts and
          techniques</h3>
        <p>There were a lot of challanging parts with this code. The popcorn box uses trangles which requires 6 points
          each. That meant a lot of trip and error to get each point lined up correctly with its corresponding
          rectangle. Additionally, getting the popcorn to work properly and in the way I wanted was hard. This was
          mainly with when to use a new variable or an existing one. Also, the writitng structre is differnt as we have
          to use this., [i],[], etc.
